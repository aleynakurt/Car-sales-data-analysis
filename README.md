Car sales data analysis with R.


# Introduction 
Two separate hypotheses were considered in the project. In the first hypothesis, we aimed to verify the effect of engine size on the horsepower of the vehicle with data analysis methods, graphs and analysis tests. As a result of the analysis, we determined that there is a correct relationship between the engine size and the horsepower of the vehicle.
In the second hypothesis, we aimed to show that Dodge brand vehicles are more expensive than Chevrolet vehicles with data analysis methods, graphics and analysis tests. However, as a result of the analyzes made, we came to the conclusion that a clear interpretation cannot be made for this hypothesis in the data set.
